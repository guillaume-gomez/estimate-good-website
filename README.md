## üì• Installation

### From Official Stores

[![Firefox Add-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox-Add--on-FF7139?style=for-the-badge&logo=firefox-browser&logoColor=white)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ecosurf-analyser/)
[![Chrome Extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chrome-Extension-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-chrome&logoColor=white)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ecosurf-analyser/ikhjihalbdlnjacdnonecbddejboajkl)

### Manual Installation (Firefox)

1. Download the repository
2. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click on "Load Temporary Add-on..."
4. Select the `manifest.json` file located in the EcoSurfAnalyser folder

## üîç How It Works

1. When you visit a website, EcoSurf contacts the EcoIndex API to check if that site has been analyzed
2. If data exists, you'll see the ecological score (A-G) in your browser's toolbar
3. If no data exists, EcoSurf requests a new analysis from the EcoIndex API
4. Using a smart heuristic approach, the extension will periodically check for new results

## üß™ Technical Details

EcoSurf Analyser integrates with the [EcoIndex API](https://github.com/cnumr/ecoindex_api), which measures:
- Page weight
- DOM complexity
- Server requests
- And many other factors that impact a site's carbon footprint
